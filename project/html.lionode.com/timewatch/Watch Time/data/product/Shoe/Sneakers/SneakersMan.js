    "description": "A modern take on the hoops icon, the Nike Air Force 1 Crater FlyKnit updates classic b-ball style with at least 20% recycled materials by weight. The super-airy FlyKnit upper features a linen-like texture while the speckled Crater foam midsole adds a modern twist. It&#039;s legendary style that&#039;s on-point and lets you give a little back with every step.",

Derived from older, nostalgic models, they take inspiration from the Air 180 and Air Max 93 - but are a brand new silhouette designed purely as a lifestyle sneak. The lightweight trainers are built with a breathable mesh and canvas upper, which comes in a fresh white colourway. Sat on a new, Max Air unit that measures 32mm (the tallest Nike have made!), they promise next-level cushioned comfort, with 270 degrees of visible Air. Finished with the iconic Swoosh to the sidewalls and Air 270 branding to the tongue and heel overlay.",
